# MIMIC_OCEL1.0
Hello,Hope you are doing good, my research can be divided in 3 steps...
1. generating an event log(folder mimic_extraction)
2. event log analysis(event_log_analysis)
3. Discovery(using disco)
4. Converting event log to OCEL(Object Centric Event Log)
5. Generating a process model from OCEL(folder discovery)



To access my event log visit https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yGLSlFGZ4esa1GBc-c8BFT5ofgkRnnnH/view?usp=sharing
